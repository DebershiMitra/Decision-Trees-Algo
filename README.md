The splitting criteria at the root could be the same or different.
the split at the root node of a decision tree might change depending on the characteristics of the dataset being used. The root node is the first node in a decision tree and is used to make the first decision about which direction to follow in the tree based on the features of the data. The root node is typically split into two or more child nodes based on a chosen feature and a split point. The decision about which feature and split point to use is made using a measure of feature importance and a criterion for evaluating the splits, such as maximizing the purity of the resulting nodes.
In general, the split at the root node of a decision tree is likely to change if the dataset has a small number of points or if the features of the data are highly correlated with the target variable. This is because a small number of points may not provide enough information to make an informed decision about the best split, and highly correlated features may dominate the decision-making process. On the other hand, if the dataset has a large number of points and the features are less correlated with the target variable, the split at the root node is likely to be more stable.

The true statements regarding overfitting in a decision tree are:
Over-attempting to get more and more pure nodes leads to overfitting.
Explanation: When a decision tree tries to create very pure nodes by splitting the data too finely, it can end up fitting the noise in the training data, leading to overfitting.
Low values of the 'min_samples_split' parameter in the Decision Tree class of sklearn lead to overfitting.
Explanation: A low value of 'min_samples_split' allows the tree to split nodes even for a small number of data points, which can lead to overfitting by creating very deep and complex trees.
